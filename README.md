This project is a simple front-end web demo that visually imitates a Google-style homepage and includes a dramatic “system override” effect triggered by a keyboard shortcut.

When the page first loads, the user sees a minimalist Google-like search interface with a large centered logo and a search bar. At any time, the user can activate a hidden sequence using a custom keybind (Shift + X by default).
